# Sentiment_Analysis

Set up Guide for Project

1. CountVector_Step_By_Step_Implementation.ipynb: This file demonstrates step by step implementation of the various steps involved in implementing the project. The text transformation uses Count Vectorization Technique.
2. TFIDF_Step_By_Step_Implementation.ipynb: This file demonstrates step by step implementation of the various steps involved in implementing the project. The text transformation uses TFIDF Technique.
The objective of the above two files is to explain the process flow of various stages in the software execution and the code used to implement those steps.
3. Sentimental_Analysis_OfCustomerReviews_System_Using_Count_Vectorization_Technique.ipynb: This file consists of the code to run the software and uses Count Vectorization Technique for text transformation. The software consists of GUI for easy usability and allow users to predict the rating of new review, analyze and compare different classification models based on their accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure.
